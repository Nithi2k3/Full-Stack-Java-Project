Hospital Selection System is a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to search for nearby hospitals and view real-time details such as bed availability, doctors, oxygen supply, ambulance services, and ratings.
The backend exposes secure REST APIs, implemented with JWT authentication and role-based access for admins and hospital staff.
Hospital information, users, staff, and feedback are stored in a MySQL database.
The system helps users quickly find suitable hospitals during emergencies.
